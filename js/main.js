function colorful(){
  return "ðŸŽ‰I promised this would be colorful, but this is a terminal, so rainbow flags it is.ðŸŽ‰ <p>ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ <p> So yeah, who am I? Colorful, and faceted, that's easy to say. But what does that mean? We'll explore here. Just wait. <p>Let's start with the simpler stuff (yes, notice the er) <p>Let's start with my sexual orientation. It's weird. It's not a secret that I am asexual, but let me explain what that means. <p>Asexuality, simply said, means the lack of sexual attraction.  <p>That's pretty simple, right? Me no enjoy sex, as a friend put it quite simple. That's easy, right? Oh, we're not finished yet.  <p>As is gender, sexuality is a 4 or more axis coordinate system. <p>We can orient it besides asexual, heterosexual, homosexual, and a lot more, and either strength of each attraction in a bar chart. <p>So that's a 5 axis chart attached with a bar chart in the 6th axis.  <p>Do you get now why I sometimes just don't label me?  <p>Yeah, that's why. Well, additionally to the fact it's a chart with bars attached, it's also a dynamic chart! One or the other day, I'll find myself feeling a bit bi, but considering I'm nonbinary (later) I rather feel pan-bi-ace? My friend and I short this to Parmesan, so do that. <p>It's out, I'm Parmesan. Let's skip to the next topic.  <p><p>Romantic attraction. <p>That might be rather complex to explain, so bear with me. <p> 'More complex than their explanation on sexual attraction?', you might ask yourself now, and you are right, but so am I. <p>I think before we start, we need to concede what romantic attraction actually is, so here's a Merriam-Webster explanation.  <p>'Romantic attraction is an emotional response what results in a desire for a romantic relationship with the recipient'  <p> Quite simple so far, right? <p>Generally spoken, attraction means the relationship existing between things or persons that are naturally or involuntarily drawn together.  <p>Also simple. We now separate between platonic relationships and romantic relationships. This step is also quite important for understanding who I am, so listen closely. The difference between romantic and platonic relationships is, simply, on a biological level that the brain emits a different messenger substance in response to a platonic relationship and a romantic relationship. Simply put, it feels different.   <p>But why do we need all this knowledge? <p>Simply put- because I don't feel romantic attraction.  <p>That doesn't mean I'm broken in any way-I'm not restricted by anything, and if I ever fall in love, what speaks against it?  <p>I could expand onto 40 hours how a society focused on getting engaged in romantic relationships as a key part doesn't really help me, but that's part for a blog entry, not for this. <p>Let's move forward, else someone's gonna fall asleep while reading this. <p>Part 3: My gender. Oh, lads, this is complex as well. First of all, we need to do something the german language can't, which this wonderful language I am speaking right now can. The English language differentiates between gender and sex. On a biological level, my sex is male. I have  X and a Y chromosome (check), I have beard growth (check), I have typical sexual organs, but I won't elaborate that further. This is the internet, which doesn't forget. <p>So yeah, that's my sex. And because this world doesn't have the technology to bio-mod DNA in human bodies, that will stay like that. That's simple, so far. It's basic biology, and I nearly had a D in Bio so this should be understandable for most people of age=n>12. <p>From reading Siegmund Freud's book on Sexual attraction and sexuality, we know that all societies have a set of gender categories that serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. To put it simpler, gender categories built characters. For example when I was born boy clothes were simply blue, and pink clothes were for girls. My mom sometimes tells the story of how I always wanted some pink glitter shoes to wear. Hehe, if she knew. In other societies such as South America or Africa, those roles are reversed or simply nonexistent. <p>These categories are simply based on the theory and the hope that an individual that gets a certain category assigned to manifest it in their lifestyle simply accepts these categories, the suggested behaviors. <p>However, for quite some time, these categories did not provide the option to not differentiate between those categories, or allow individuals to switch categories as by their wishes. For decades and more, individuals not being able to understand and welcome themselves to their assigned gender category simply was suppressed and even worse, heavily prosecuted. This is awful behavior has bettered through increasing awareness, first with Trans*-Persons. <p><p>Yet, however, you, dear reader, might ask yourself, but what if a certain character does not assign themselves with either category society provides them? Simply said, they make their own category to affiliate with. Now, to be exact, whereas 80 years ago you could have imagined gender as a two x tuple of W and M, this has simply changed. For good. <p>And here I come, who built themselves their own category. <p>You might have noticed I'm strictly using they/them pronouns for myself in this text-that because that's what my pronouns are. Singular they, a normal grammatical form that is encouraged by the APA. <p>What does it mean I am non-binary? Nothing that special, besides my pronouns and the fact I just am neither male nor female, and if you'd like to disagree besides on a biological level, go away, drink a beer, or something.  <p>Closing statements and TL;DR: <p>TL;DR: I am Parmesan, and NonBinary, other than sex, gender is merely a construction and coordination societies built themselves to orient them. We are in fact the only race that has been observed to do so. <p><p>Special thanks: Queer friends all over the world, you all are awesome. You, dear reader, for reading through this mess.  <p>You, dear reader, for accepting me like I am. <p>You all out there, fighting for the freedom of speech and freedom of movement. Keep up the good fight. <p><p>";
